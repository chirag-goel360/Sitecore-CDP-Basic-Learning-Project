        A guest is any person that interacts with your brand, regardless of whether they are identified.
        
        The guest is the core entity of Sitecore Customer Data Platform (CDP). Each guest has a unique guest profile that contains all relevant transactional and behavioral data that is sent to the platform through Sitecore CDP APIs.
        
        The data available in the guest profile depends on your organization's requirements and identity rules. Sitecore CDP refers to the process of identifying guests as identity resolution.
